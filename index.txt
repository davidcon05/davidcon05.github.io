About me

I'm a Software Development Engineer in Test specializing in native mobile testing and automation for both Android and iOS. I enjoy providing automation that supports high velocity development, providing precisison manual testing and contributing to FE workstreams when I can. I'm currently working in Raleigh, North Carolina but open to relocating for the right fit.

My job is to build your website so that it is functional and user-friendly but at the same time attractive. Moreover, I add personal touch to your product and make sure that is eye-catching and easy to use. My aim is to bring across your message and identity in the most creative way. I created web design for many famous brand companies.
